# yet-another-emacs

Is my personal emacs config and it is based on the earlier yet-another-emacs. I have tried to make it faster and saner than the old defaults.


# It Uses

  + ivy as a completion framework

  + doom-line

  + dired-sidebar for side tab file manager

  + hydra

  + projectile

  + modshift key for extra characters to expand the keymap

  + etc ...
